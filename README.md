## 🚀 Features  
✔️ Handles multiple intents like **greetings, finance, investing, freelancing, negotiation**, etc.  
✔️ Uses **TF-IDF** to transform text data into numerical form.  
✔️ Implements **Logistic Regression** for intent classification.  
✔️ Tokenizes input using **NLTK’s `word_tokenize`**.  
✔️ Built with **Streamlit** for an interactive web interface.
